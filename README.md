# Sorting-Searching
Code that executes a few search and sort algorithms.

Sorting algos:
 - Max Sort
 - Selection Sort
 - Bubble Sort
 
Searching algos:
 - Linear Search
 - Binary Search
 
Input consists of a single integer N -> repesenting the length of the array. An array of length N is then randomly generated by
sampling input from the uniform integer distribution.
Output:
 - For Searches: the index of the searched key (-1 if not found) and the time taken to execute the search in ns.
 - For Sorts: the sorted list and the time taken to execute the sort in ns.
